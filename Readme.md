#Level 11 CPU
*(We skipped ten and cranked it straight up to eleven)*

##The AI that beats you at Melee

The level 11 CPU is an AI that plays Super Smash Bros: Melee inside the Dolphin emulator. The goal is to make an AI that human beings cannot defeat.

###FAQ

1. **What character does the AI play?**

    Fox, of course!

2. **Does the Level 11 CPU cheat?**

    The short answer is: No.

    The long answer is that the CPU only interfaces with the game by pressing buttons on a virtual controller. There isn't anything it does that you **couldn't** do in principle. It just so happens, however, that a computer is much faster and more reliable than you, so it's able to do things that a human realistically can't.

3. **Are there any current limitations to the AI?**

    Yes, right now the CPU is limited to playing against Marth only, and on Final Destination. Support for other characters and stages will be added soon.

4. **How is the AI designed?**

    The level 11 CPU makes decisions on a 4 tiered hierarchy of objectives: Goals, Strategies, Tactics, and Chains. Each objective inspects the current game state and decides which lower level objective will be best to achieve it.

    **Goals** are the highest level objective, and inform the AI what the intended overall outcome should be. IE: Beating our opponent in a match, or navigating the menu to select our character.

    **Strategies** are the highest level means that the AI will use to accomplish the overall goal. For instance, the level 11 CPU will typically take the strategy of baiting the opponent into a poor move.

    **Tactics** are lowish level series of predictable circumstances that we can realistically flowchart our way through. For instance, if the enemy if off the stage we may choose to edge guard them to keep them from getting back on.

    **Chains** are the lowest level of objective that consists of a "chain" of button presses that Smashers will recognize, such as Wavedash, Jump-canceled Upsmash, etc...

5. **Can I play it on a regular Gamecube or hacked Wii?**

    For right now, the level 11 CPU only runs on a PC as a normal computer program. (Meaning that Melee has to be in an emulator) But I do want to get it running on actual Gamecube/Wii hardware. If you'd like to help with this, let me know!

6. **What Operating Systems does it play on?**

    The CPU only runs on Linux. Under the hood, we use a named pipe input system to Dolphin, which is *nix only. There are no plans to make a Windows port. If we're going to spend time porting, it's going to be to a Gamecube/Wii.

##Rough Setup Steps:

###Works on: Ubuntu 15.04 (Maybe others, but that's all I've tested)

1. Get a build of dolphin from source (dolphin version must be >= 4.0-8501 (commit afde6ae)). You can find it here:
https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin - If you want to play on the dolphin netplay build (7840), follow instructions from here - https://github.com/xesquirmy/dolphin-7840-memorywatcher
2. Configure your controller settings for player 1 and player 2. You will play as Player 1, the CPU will take Player 2. You'll probably want a GameCube controller adapter. Configuring controller settings is out of the scope of this document, but check out the file `GCPadNew.ini` provided here for an example controller config that ought to work. Just stick that in your Dolphin config directory.
3. Build the CPU code by just running make. `make` There shouldn't be any dependencies to download. (Other than Dolphin)
4. Run `./cpu`
5. Run dolphin and start up Melee.
6. Move focus over to the dolphin window. (Or else turn on background input on the controller) Just click on the dolphin window to do this.
7. If using the Netplay Gecko code, exit the character select screen (CSS), and re-enter the CSS. The CPU will choose its own character. Select your character as Marth. Set the stage to Final Destination. Start the match.
